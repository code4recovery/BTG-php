# BTG-php
This repository is a simple port of the ColdFusion code located in BTG-cfm into a 
similar functioning means of keeping track of volunteers for the AA Bridge-the-Gap 
program. This code is not meant for use of distribution but is a step in towards
an eventual (hopefully!) useful product for AA service entities.
